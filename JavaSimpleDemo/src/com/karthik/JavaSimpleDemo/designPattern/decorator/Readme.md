# Decorator Desgin Pattern

##What is decorator design pattern in Java?

-  Decorator design pattern is used to enhance the functionality of a particular object at run-time or 	dynamically.
-  At the same time other instance of same class will not be affected by this so individual object gets 	the new behavior.
-  Basically we wrap the original object through decorator object.
-  Decorator design pattern is based on abstract classes and we derive concrete implementation from that 	classes,
-  It’s a structural design pattern and most widely used.


##When to use Decorator pattern in Java

-         When sub classing is become impractical and we need large number of different possibilities to make independent object or we can say we have number of combination for an object.

-          Secondly when we want to add functionality to individual object not to all object at run-time we use decorator design pattern.
